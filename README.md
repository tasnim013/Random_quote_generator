# Random quote generator - Python Web scrapping

This repository contains the necessary files to make a random quote generator. The user will get three different categories to choose. The list of the files are the following:

1. index.html
2. style.css
3. script.js
4. jupyter notebook
5. Datafiles   

# Steps to Complete the project
To generate this website, I have gone through three parts. 

1. First, I have scraped the actual quotes and authors(or movie names) of the respective categories from three websites. The link of the source websites are given in the respective jupyter notebooks. I have used Beautyful Soup Python library for the scrapping process.
2. Next, I have stored the collected quotes and authors in three different json files.
3. Finally, I used javascript (script.js) to read the respective files and randomly select a quote to show on website. I have used index.html to build the skeleton of the website and style.css to make it beautiful.
